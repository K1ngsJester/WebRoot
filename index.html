                    <p>Hello, as a college student in a Application Development program and prior active duty Marine, 
                        I have continued to improve myself and learn skills to better myself and my team. 
                        As a Marine I learned how to lead from the best of the best. 
                        In college I have learned how to build basic application and web pages while striving to exceed on my own.
                        I learned to use my resources to hold my own in this field and stratigies to solve a mulitiude of problems.
                        </p>
                </div>
